r"""The Frame Generation row: every locale fits, and its cells react.

Two properties of the same row, both regressions of the v1.17.0 redesign.

1. FIT. The row is a label plus a segment group of four cells - Off, x2, x3,
   x4 - right-aligned against the panel. The cells used to be sized to the
   WIDEST label, which is "off": three characters in English and eleven in
   Spanish ("desactivado"). Three two-character steps were each given that
   width, the group took 380 px of the row's 488, and the control's own name
   was clipped into what was left. Measured, not asserted by eye: the label
   must fit beside the group in all twelve languages.

2. HOVER. The row carries no click zone of its own (`hit` is None) - its
   cells do. The hover loop fell back to the row's rect, and since the toggle
   is built before its cells and spans the panel, the cursor over x3 matched
   the toggle and broke out: no cell ever highlighted, and the row draws no
   ring, so there was no feedback at all before the click.
