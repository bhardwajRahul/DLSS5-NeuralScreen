r"""Minimise to tray and close to tray, and what they must not do (#93).

"When you minimize NeuralScreen, it remains in the Start menu as a
minimized window, goes to the tray, but doesn't disappear. Or there's no
option in the settings for 'minimize to tray' or 'close to tray'."

Three things have to hold, and each was a way to get this wrong.

1. THE POLICY IS ASKED, NOT ASSUMED. The window procedure runs on its own
   thread and must not read the config, so the two answers are pushed into
   it. With both off, minimise and close behave exactly as before - the 1x1
   window is never really minimised (its taskbar button would go with it)
   and close is ignored, so the button cannot be lost for the session.
2. THE PASS KEEPS RUNNING. The picture on screen is this program's output.
   A "minimise" that also stopped the neural pass would change what the
   user is looking at without saying so; going to the tray hides the panel
   and the button, and nothing else.
3. THE WAY BACK EXISTS. Asking for the menu from the tray restores the
   taskbar button first - a menu with no button in the taskbar is the state
   the ticket is complaining about.

The window procedure is driven directly with the messages Windows sends,
rather than through a real taskbar: the point is which command each
message produces under each setting, and that is the part that has to be
right.
