r"""The NR cascade: the count reaches the worker, and lands in the right buffer.

Three separate things can silently undo the cascade, and none of them shows up
as an error:

1. THE WIRE. The pass count rides in bits 2-4 of the RNSZ flags word - a field
   squeezed into an existing struct because the layout mirrors the D5V3 header
   and a hundred tests build it by position. Both ends have to agree on the
   shift, the mask and the ceiling, and they are written out twice: once in
   protocol.py and once in the worker's C++.

2. THE HAND-OFF. Every RNSZ has to carry the count, and the stream header has
   no room for one at all - so a saved `nr_passes` reaches the worker only
   when something sends a resize. A config asking for two passes showed "2" in
   the panel while one pass ran, because nothing sent an RNSZ at startup
   (audit 20.09).

3. WHERE THE LAST PASS LANDS. Everything downstream - the residual composite,
   the scale-up, the present - reads `v.nr_out`. The cascade ping-pongs
   between two scratch buffers, so pass 0 has to start on whichever one makes
   the parity come out right. The other way to get there is to let it land
   wherever and swap the two pointers afterwards, and that is a trap: it
   changes WHICH resource v.nr_out is from frame to frame, and both composites
   cache their descriptors on exactly that pointer. An even pass count would
   rewrite a shader-visible descriptor heap every frame while up to two
   earlier frames are still reading it.
