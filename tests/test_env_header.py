"""The environment header in the log: version, OS, HDR, driver.

Users paste NeuralScreen.log into issues; the [env] header answers the
questions we would otherwise have to ask (which version, which Windows,
is HDR on, which driver). Every probe is wrapped - a missing API or a
stripped system must not crash the startup, the line is simply skipped.

Checked: the header prints the version and the OS; the HDR line is
always present (on/off/unknown); a broken probe (monkeypatched to
raise) does not crash the caller.
