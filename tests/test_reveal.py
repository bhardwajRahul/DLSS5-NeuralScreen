"""The present window must not flash blank: it stays hidden until the first
successful Present.

The worker's picture window (NeuralScreenPresent) used to be shown right at
creation - a blank topmost window flashed black over the desktop during the
NGX warm-up on every start and on every one-window mode switch. Now it is
created hidden and revealed only after the first real Present.

Checks (by window visibility, no log dependence):
* shortly after launch (warm-up still running) the window exists but is
  HIDDEN - the old code showed it immediately;
* after the warm-up the window becomes VISIBLE (the first Present revealed it).
